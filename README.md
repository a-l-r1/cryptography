# Code for Cryptography Experiments

## Introduction

This repository contains Python and Java source code for Cryptography Experiments, one of my lessons. Since the lesson has finished and the grades have been calculated, I decided to make the source code open.

## Contents

```
java/       Java code: RSA from scratch
report/     Reports without sensitive information
README.md   This file
*.py        Python code for the rest of the experiments
```

## Beware!

This is pre-alpha quality code. Dragons ahead. **DO NOT USE IT ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.**
